# PEOtry
there was a stern punk miss from ohhh conneticut 
her best friend
she would surely get
in chicago
where a new hampshire 
cool girl
eve sudol
more lovely than a doll
giggled and stole her heart 
now together they make art
what a sight to see
a garden where they'll be
in their own little world 
milkshakes and skirts that twirl
even on a winter chicago day
they bring sunlight always
a lovely sight to see
makes me happy to be me


lemon in the garbage disposal 
kitchen is now a lovely aroma
made in china
let's go outside uh
down to the creek
